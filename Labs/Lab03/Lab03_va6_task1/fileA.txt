Broken things have their own say beauty
after years of victories and tragedies
soaked in them
they are much more romatic
than new things
that haven't yet lived.
The smallest good
is better then the greates intention.
Its not what wordl holds for you
its what you bring in it.
The life is a perfect graveyard
of buried hopes.
